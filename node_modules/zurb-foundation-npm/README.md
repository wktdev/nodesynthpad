zurb-foundation-npm
===================

A simple and stock dependency of Zurb's Foundation 5 frontend framework.

I created this because I knew of no other NPM implementation of Zurb's Foundation 5 framework.

I also have a similar Bower Dependency [here](https://github.com/JDillon522/zurb-foundation-bower).

This is for those who wish to avoid having to deal with another package management system.
